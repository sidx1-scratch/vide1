### VIDE1 Name Meaning

VIDE1 intentionally carries **two complementary expansions**, reflecting the dual nature of the tool:

- **Vim Integrated Development Environment**  
- **Vim Inbuilt-editing Dynamically-tiling file Explorer**

These two meanings describe the two halves of VIDE1’s identity: a modal, keyboard-driven editor inspired by Vim, and a dynamic tiling file explorer inspired by modern tiling window managers.

---

## Why VIDE1 Has Two Meanings

VIDE1 was designed from the start to be both an editor and an environment. Traditional terminal tools tend to split these roles: one program for editing, another for file navigation, another for terminal panes, another for workspace management. VIDE1 merges all of these into a single binary.

Because of that hybrid nature, the name intentionally reflects **both sides of the tool**:

- As a **Vim Integrated Development Environment**, VIDE1 behaves like a lightweight modal IDE with panes, previews, terminals, and editing modes.
- As a **Vim Inbuilt-editing Dynamically-tiling file Explorer**, VIDE1 behaves like a fast, Miller-column file navigator with dynamic tiling and inline editing.

The dual meaning isn’t a pun — it’s a declaration of scope. VIDE1 is not just an editor with a file tree, and not just a file manager with an editor bolted on. It is both, equally, by design.

This dual identity guides its architecture, keybindings, and workflow philosophy:  
**everything is a pane, everything is modal, everything is keyboard-first.**


## Overview

VIDE1 is a **fully keyboard-driven, terminal-native** development workspace that combines a Vim-style file browser, a Hyprland-style dynamic tiling layout engine, an inline code editor, an asynchronous syntax-highlighted file previewer, and a live embedded PTY shell — all inside a single TUI binary written in pure Go.

No Electron. No LSP daemon. No config files needed to get started. Just launch and go.

---

## Features

### 🗂️ Miller Column File Browser
Navigate your filesystem using the classic [Miller Columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns) pattern — three columns showing your parent directory, current directory, and a live preview of the selected item.

### 🪟 Hyprland-Style Dynamic Tiling
Split any pane horizontally or vertically on demand. The layout engine recursively partitions terminal dimensions using a binary tree — every pane gets exactly the space it deserves, recalculated live on resize.

### 🔍 Async Syntax-Highlighted Preview
Hover over any code file and a goroutine immediately fires to load and highlight it using [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma). The UI never blocks. Line numbers included.

### ✏️ Inline Vim Editor
Open any file directly inside a tiling pane. A fully modal editor — **Normal**, **Insert**, and **Command** modes — with no external process spawned. Your buffer, your pane, your workspace.

### 💻 Embedded PTY Terminal
Spawn a live interactive shell inside any pane with `ctrl+t`. Keyboard input is piped directly to the shell process via a pseudo-terminal. `stdout`/`stderr` stream back in real time.

### 🎨 TrueColor Aesthetics
- 24-bit color One Dark palette
- Nerd Font icons next to every file entry
- Per-extension neon color coding
- Rounded gradient borders (active pane: magenta, inactive: gray)
- Color-coded status bar showing current mode and path

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- A terminal with TrueColor support (kitty, Alacritty, WezTerm, iTerm2, etc.)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed and set as your terminal font (for icons)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidx1-scratch/vide1
cd vide1
go build -o vide1 .
./vide1
```

Or run directly without building:

```bash
go run . 
```

---
### Install a release
If you dont want to mess around with go or git you can download a release ( linux only for now )

### Install to PATH (System-wide)

To make VIDE1 available from anywhere on your system, install it to a directory in your `PATH`:

#### Option 1: Install to /usr/local/bin (Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Build and install system-wide
sudo go build -o /usr/local/bin/vide1 .

# Or if you already built it
sudo cp vide1 /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Option 2: Install to ~/.local/bin (User-local, Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

# Build and install
go build -o ~/.local/bin/vide1 .

# Or copy existing binary
cp vide1 ~/.local/bin/

# Add ~/.local/bin to your PATH if not already there
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# Or for Zsh:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Option 3: Install to Windows PATH

```cmd
# Build the binary
go build -o vide1.exe .

# Copy to a directory in your PATH (e.g., C:\Tools)
mkdir C:\Tools
copy vide1.exe C:\Tools\

# Add to PATH (Run as Administrator)
setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Tools"
```

#### Option 4: Use Go install (Recommended for Go developers)

```bash
# This installs directly to $GOPATH/bin (which should be in your PATH)
go install github.com/sidx1-scratch/vide1@latest
```

After installation, you can run VIDE1 from any directory:

```bash
vide1
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Launch VIDE1 from your terminal:

```bash
# Start in current directory
vide1

# Start in a specific directory
vide1 /path/to/project

# Start in your home directory
vide1 ~
```

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Navigate the file tree** using `j`/`k` to move up/down
2. **Enter a directory** with `l`, `→`, or `Enter`
3. **Go back** with `h` or `←`
4. **Preview files** automatically — just select them
5. **Open a file for editing** with `e`
6. **Edit files** using Vim-like modal editing:
   - `i` to enter Insert mode
   - `Esc` to return to Normal mode
   - `:` to enter Command mode
   - `:w` to save, `:q` to quit
7. **Split panes** with `Ctrl+w`
8. **Open a terminal** with `Ctrl+t`
9. **Switch panes** with `Tab`
10. **Quit** with `q` or `Ctrl+c`

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Start VIDE1 in your project
vide1 ~/myproject

# Navigate to src/
j j l (or use arrow keys)

# Open main.go for editing
e

# Enter insert mode and make changes
i

# Save and return to normal mode
Esc
:w

# Quit the editor
:q

# Split the pane to see terminal
Ctrl+w

# Open a terminal in the new pane
Ctrl+t

# Switch back to file browser
Tab

# Quit VIDE1
q
```

### Advanced Usage Tips

- **Multiple panes**: Create a complex layout by repeatedly splitting panes with `Ctrl+w`
- **Terminal integration**: Run commands in the terminal pane while editing files in another
- **File preview**: Preview files without opening them by navigating through the file tree
- **Quick navigation**: Use `h` and `l` to quickly traverse directory structures
- **Workspace management**: Create custom layouts for different projects

## Architecture

```
vide1/
├── main.go           # Bubble Tea model, tiling WM (wmModel), pane navigator (paneModel)
├── load_file.go      # Async file loader → Chroma syntax highlighter → tea.Cmd
├── terminal_pane.go  # PTY-backed TerminalPane, goroutine read loop, key routing
├── theme.go          # TrueColor palette, Nerd Font icons, per-ext styles, status bar
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

### Key design decisions

- **Binary tree layout** — each pane is a leaf node. Splitting morphs a leaf into an internal node with two children. `renderNode` recurses to distribute width/height.
- **Bubble Tea command model** — all async work (file reads, PTY reads) returns `tea.Cmd` and communicates via typed messages (`fileLoadedMsg`, `termOutputMsg`). No shared state between goroutines and the main loop.
- **Single binary, zero runtime deps** — no config daemon, no server, no LSP. Just the binary.
